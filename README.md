# Arc Comics

An app built for mobiles that lets you view and read comics and manga on a komga server

## Getting Started

Firstly you need to have a Komga server up and running, you can find that here: https://github.com/gotson/komga
Shoutout to Gotson for developing this awesome piece of software!

Then you need to download the app and install it to your device, you can also build it from source if you like.
Downloads for android can be found here: https://github.com/lukeslife/Arc-Comics/releases

You then need to add your server information and your username and password in the add server screen, you can add more than one server.

Once added you can pick a server and start exploring your libraries and comics/manga

##Notes

Flutter is cross platform and should work for iPhone, prehaps some changes would be needed to make it work correctly but as I do not have an iPhone or a Mac needed for development I am not able to release a version for this OS, maybe sometime in the future if I ever get my hands on a dev enviroment.
